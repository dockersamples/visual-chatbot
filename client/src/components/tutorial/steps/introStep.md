This tool is intended to help you better understand how LLM-based applications operate behind the scenes and help you realize they aren't as challenging as you might think.

We're going to explain everything and have some fun along the way. You'll learn about:

- The Chat Completions API
- What is RAG?
- How do tools work?
- How does MCP fit into the picture?

This knowledge will help you both in building your own GenAI applications and understanding how the other tools you use work.

Sounds fun, right? Well, let's get started!
